# Administrative Divisions of Kazakhstan: Historical Changes and Borders

## Introduction

This project aims to document the historical changes in the administrative divisions and borders of Kazakhstan since 1992. It addresses the lack of comprehensive and accurate data on the evolving administrative divisions of Kazakhstan, providing a reliable resource for researchers, analysts, and anyone interested in studying the country's administrative structure over time.

The project utilizes Geographic Information System (GIS) data, generating Shapefile (.shp) and associated attribute files (.dbf) to track and visualize the changes in administrative divisions. The repository will be regularly updated to incorporate new data and revisions, ensuring the repository remains up-to-date.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- **data**: This directory stores the Shapefile (.shp) and associated attribute files (.dbf) representing the administrative divisions of Kazakhstan at different time periods. Each subdirectory within this directory corresponds to a specific year or time range, containing the respective Shapefile and attribute files.

- **docs**: This directory contains additional documentation and resources related to the project, such as metadata files, data dictionaries, or relevant research papers.

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the contents of the repository.
